<h4><b><i>Project 1 : Wordle</i></b></h4>
<p>
  Wordle is a popular game available on multiple websites, with the most prominent being the New York Times.<br>
  I remember spending my first-year lectures playing this game with my friends, trying to achieve a streak of correct guesses.<br>
  I tried replicating a somewhat similar code. Although it's not inch perfect, I learned about concepts related to multiple loops and conditional statements used in programming, as well as nested loops, while building this project.
