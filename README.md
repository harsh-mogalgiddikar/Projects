<h4><b><i>Project 1 : Wordle</i></b></h4>
<p>
  Wordle is a popular game available on multiple websites, with the most prominent being the New York Times.<br>
  I remember spending my first-year lectures playing this game with my friends, trying to achieve a streak of correct guesses.<br>
  I tried replicating a somewhat similar code. Although it's not inch perfect, I learned about concepts related to multiple loops and conditional statements used in programming, as well as nested loops, while building this project.

<h4><b><i>Project 2 : Task Manager</i></b></h4>
<p>
  One of the most basic level projects I thought I could implement was a task manager. The task manager I made had only a few fucntions and not the best data handling algorithm is being used. However i also learned a lot while working on this project, about different operations that can be done on arrays,switch-case,to check for conditions when taking inputs from user etc.

<h4><b><i>Project 3 : Random Password Generator</i></b></h4>
<p>
  I guess this is one project everyone does at some point in time. Although seemed easy at first and condtions needed to check/compare were a bit tricky and needed some thinking. String manupilation, handling user input and finally implementation of randomizer was very fun and learning to do.
